"""The scorer. Two TODO markers, and it is the most important file today.

A prompt change is not an improvement until it has been measured, and this
is what measures it. Write it before you tune anything, because a scorer
written after you have seen the output tends to score what the output
already does.

One rule, and it decides most of the marks in this session: report per
field, as counts. Never one overall accuracy. Ten records means one error
moves a percentage by ten points, and an average across four fields hides
the only interesting thing in the data, which is that they do not move
together.

    Three of the four fields compare in the obvious way. One does not.

    category and urgency are closed label sets, so equality is the whole
        test and a wrong answer is detectable with no model involved. That
        is why the task was designed with closed label sets.

    due_date needs care. The gold is either an ISO date string or None.
        Decide now what you do about `""`, about `"null"` as a string, and
        about a correctly formatted date that is simply the wrong date. Two
        of those three are the same kind of wrong and one is not, and your
        DECISIONS.md should say which convention you chose.

    quote is the interesting one and it is free. The record is correct only
        if the string the model returned appears verbatim inside
        `document_text`. Use `in`. Do not lowercase, do not strip
        punctuation, do not "be reasonable about whitespace". The moment you
        relax this check you have stopped measuring whether the model copied
        and started measuring whether it approximately copied, and the whole
        value of the field was that it was exact.
