"""Block 3. The few-shot variant, and the honest comparison.

    python 02_few_shot.py --replay
    python 02_few_shot.py

Same schema, same scorer, same ten documents. One variable changes, which is
the presence of examples. That is the whole experimental design, and it is
the part most student comparisons get wrong.

Two ways to break it, both easy and both fatal:

  * editing the schema or the scorer between the two runs, which makes the
    two numbers incomparable
  * taking examples from DOCS, which turns the second measurement into a
    memory test. Examples come from EXAMPLE_POOL, which is held out for
    exactly this reason.

Two TODO markers.

    """Return the example block that gets appended to the system prompt.

    Choose from EXAMPLE_POOL, never from DOCS. Three to five examples. Fewer
    is usually better than more, and you pay for every one of them in input
    tokens on every single call, forever.

    Choose deliberately, one per thing you could not say clearly in words:

      * a boundary you struggled to define, for example the line between
        facilities and hardware
      * a message with no stated deadline, which demonstrates the null
        convention rather than describing it
      * a message in a language other than English, because the corpus is
        multilingual and an all English example block quietly teaches the
        model that English is the norm

    Write the reason for each choice in DECISIONS.md. "It seemed useful" is
    not a reason, and at the checkpoint you will be asked which field each
    example was meant to move.

    One trap worth knowing before you fall into it. Whatever you show in the
    `quote` field of your examples is what the model will imitate. If your
    examples carry truncated or tidied quotes, you have just taught it to
    stop copying verbatim, and the field that scored perfectly zero-shot
    will get worse. Look at the recording if you want to see that happen.

    #      one overall number. The interesting content is that they do not
