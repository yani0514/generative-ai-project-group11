    1. The call produced no valid decision at all. Rare, and it still has to
       be handled, because the alternative is a crash on the one message
       unusual enough to break the schema.

    2. The evidence check, inherited from week 2 and still free. Is the
       evidence span actually in `text`? A router that invents its
       justification is a router you cannot audit. Note that this checks
       honesty, not correctness: a route can be right with fabricated
       evidence, and that is still a defect, because the evidence is what a
       human reviewing a misroute will read.

    3. The confidence floor from TODO 3a.

    it None when the decision stood. You will count these at the checkpoint,
