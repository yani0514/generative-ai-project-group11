    #   a. Name the confusion pairs and say which DIRECTION they point. If
    #      they all point into one route, that route's definition is too
    #      wide, and the fix is the definition rather than the prompt.
    #   b. What fraction of the routed system's tokens is the routing call?
    #      The routed system makes two calls where the monolith makes one,
    #      so it has to buy something with that.
    #   c. What can each specialist be forbidden to do, now that it only
    #      handles one kind of message? Could the monolith be given the same
    #      instruction? That question is the real argument for routing.
    #   d. Would you ship the router, on what evidence, and what would
    #      change your mind? At twenty four queries the accuracy difference
    #      is probably inside the noise, and saying so is worth more than
    #      claiming a win.
