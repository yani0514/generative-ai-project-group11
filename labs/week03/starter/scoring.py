"""Scoring the router. TODO 5.

Two rules carried over from week 2 and one new one.

Carried over: report per route, as counts, never one overall percentage. At
four to seven gold records per route, one misroute moves that route by
fifteen to twenty five points, and a percentage at that sample size is a
lie told with a decimal point.

New this week: the confusion pairs matter more than the accuracy. Knowing
that the router is 20 out of 24 tells you to try harder. Knowing that it
sends requests to info, and only in that direction, tells you which
definition is wrong.

    `results` is a list of `Routed`, aligned with `queries`.

    One judgment call you have to make deliberately, and it goes in
    DECISIONS.md. Do you score against `applied_route`, which is what the
    system actually did, or against `decision.route`, which is what the
    classifier wanted to do? They differ exactly when your policy fired.

    Scoring the intention flatters the system, because it takes credit for
    routes the policy overrode. Scoring what happened is what the sender
    experienced. Pick one for the headline number and say why.

    Fill in, per query: the per-route counts, the confusion pair when it is
    wrong, whether the evidence was verbatim, which policy check fired, the
    confidence value, and whether the query was one of the ambiguous four.
